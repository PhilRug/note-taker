## Description
Is your day chaotic? Do you need a way to have an organized to-do list on hand? Look no further! Using front and back end programming, you can create items for a to-do list and delete them with ease.

This was exceptionally challenging, since none of the previous class videos were uploaded during the time creating this. I repurposed a decent amount of code from lessons and the mini project to fill in where I was unsure what to do next.
